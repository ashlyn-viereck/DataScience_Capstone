# Data Science Capstone
## Deep Fake Detection using Deep Learning Methods 

**Dataset of focus**  - WELFake dataset

**Models** - Naive Bayes, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN model 

##Current results##

**Naive Bayes** - 82% accuracy 

**LSTM** - 95% accuracy 

**Enhancement** - I will be attempting to add a retrieval / evidence-based component that uses google search engines to look for references to similar topics to gauge whether there is evidence to support the article. 


P.S. 
I had to make a new repository due to some issues with my previous repository!
