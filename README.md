# Data Science Capstone
## Deep Fake Detection using Deep Learning Methods 

**Dataset of focus**  - WELFake dataset

**Models** - Naive Bayes, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN model 

## Current results 

**Naive Bayes** - 82% accuracy 

**LSTM** - 95% accuracy 

**Enhancement** - I will be attempting to add a retrieval / evidence-based component that uses google search engines to look for references to similar topics to gauge whether there is evidence to support the article. 



Install/ Setup 

Step one: 

pip install google-search-results
-- Also probably mention necessary set up for colab or downloading code or whateever 

Step two: 

Create a free account on https://serpapi.com/ (or any other alternatice Serp API) 

Step three: 

Generate a uniqiue API key 

Step four: 

Replace the "secret_api_key" with your newly generated API key
